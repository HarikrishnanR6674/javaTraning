Subquery

   -- select query inside another select query

   -- subquery is used to retrive data based on unknown condition

   -- inner query will be executed first, based on the output outer query will be executed

   -- 2 types

       1. Single row subquery -- inner query returns only single row, then it is evaluated with outer query using =,!=,>,<,>=,<=

       2. Multi row subquery -- inner query returns multiple rows and it is evaluated with outer query using in, not in, exists, not exists, all, any

Join

  -- at the time of displaying we can join the tables

Types

1. Equi join

     -- we join the table based on some equality condition

      emp                                          dept

Inner join

   -- similar to equi join

select e.ename,d.dname from emp e inner join dept d on e.deptid=d.deptid;

Outer join

   -- will display both matched and unmatched column

3 types

1. Left outer join

     -- all rows from left table + only matched rows from right table

 

select e.ename,d.dname from emp e left join dept d on e.deptid=d.deptid;

2. Right outer join

     -- all rows from right table + only matched rows from left table

 

select e.ename,d.dname from emp e right join dept d on e.deptid=d.deptid;

3. Full outer join

       -- all matched and unmatched rows from both the table

       -- in mysql there is no full outer join

 

select e.ename,d.dname from emp e left join dept d on e.deptid=d.deptid

union

select e.ename,d.dname from emp e right join dept d on e.deptid=d.deptid;

 

4. Cross join

       -- cartesian product of two table
