XML

  - XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.

  - XML was designed to store and transport data.

  - XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.

  - XML is often used for distributing data over the Internet.

  - XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags (ie) user defined tags

<b>hello</b> -in HTML  -hello in bold format  - display the data

<b>hello</b> -in XML-  describe the data

 

XML Simplifies Things

It simplifies data sharing

It simplifies data transport

It simplifies platform changes

It simplifies data availability

Many computer systems contain data in incompatible formats. Exchanging data between incompatible systems (or upgraded systems) is a time-consuming task for web developers. 

Large amounts of data must be converted, and incompatible data is often lost.

 

XML stores data in plain text format. This provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting, and sharing data.

 

XML also makes it easier to expand or upgrade to new operating systems, new applications, or new browsers, without losing data.

 

With XML, data can be available to all kinds of "reading machines" like people, computers, voice machines, news feeds, etc.

 

 

XML Syntax Rules

1. The XML Prolog <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

2.XML Documents Must Have one Root Element

3. All XML Elements Must Have a Closing Tag

4. XML Tags are Case Sensitive

5. XML Elements Must be Properly Nested

6. XML Attribute Values Must Always be Quoted

7. White-space is Preserved in XML

8. <!-- This is a comment --> Comment statement

 

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<note>

  <to>Tove</to>

  <from>Jani</from>

  <heading>Reminder</heading>

Building block of XML

1. XML Element

An element can contain:

  - text

           <hello>welcome<\hello>

  - attributes

<hello age="20">welcome</hello>

  - other elements


  - or a mix of the above

 

XML elements must follow these naming rules:

 

Element names are case-sensitive

Element names must start with a letter or underscore

Element names cannot start with the letters xml (or XML, or Xml, etc)

Element names can contain letters, digits, hyphens, underscores, and periods

Element names cannot contain spaces

Avoid ".",":","-"

 

2. XML Attribute

Attributes are designed to contain data related to a specific element.

Attribute values must always be quoted. Either single or double quotes can be used.

attributes cannot contain multiple values (elements can)

attributes cannot contain tree structures (elements can)

attributes are not easily expandable (for future changes)

 

2 types

1. Well formed XML - follows 7 basic xml syntax rules

2. Valid XML  - XML which contains DTD file
