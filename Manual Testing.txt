SDLC:
1.Requirement collection:
2.Feasibility analysis: within the company(requirement)
3.Design:blueprint 
4.Coding:implement from the blueprint-->module---->coding based on the architect
5.Testing:based on the blueprint the test case ll be written 


Login page 

username:
password:


--->The test case ll be written in the excel sheet.

  Ex: username, password ,click button,valid name ,special character

--->manually the page ll be check by the tester by making the action in the certain page

Manual Testing vs Automated Testing 


Types of Testing

      1.Whitebox Testing ---->testing done by developer by using junit.


      2.Blackbox Testing ----->tester can perform this test

1.functional Testing:Each and every component cen be check by invidualy like each element like button field.

2.Integeration Testing:user interface checking like add to cart(relationship between two modules)

3.system Testing:  E to E testing all the interface are working fine or not like that 

4.Smoke Testing:  checking Url is working or not 

5.Regression Testing :Automated testing only (contains 1000 of test cases contain in test suit )when the new build is added the test case also added 
                                    --->finally the test should perform succesfully  with all the test cases

       3.Performance Testing ---->performance of the application while more no of people usin the same 


1.Load Testing ----->Jmeter,apache 

2.Stress Testing------>jmeter

      4.Compatability testing---->using different platforms checking 

      5.Usability testing------>UI Neatnesss and user friendly.

      6.Security Testing---->Privacy (cyberSecurity tools) Pin passwords -->Third party testers

      7.Localization and Internalization------>process of adding cultural needs in th certain locality and design these into th entire project is known as this.
