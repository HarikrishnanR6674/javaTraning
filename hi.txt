I want to tell you story.
 
I was driving a little pony-and-cart for the swift delivery company and I often went in and out of the docks.

I was not realy a theif.But I usually left the docks with something under my apron. i had made the apron myself and it was a big one.


When there was a banana boat in the docks i drove my little cart beside it .

Sometimes bunches of banans fell tothe ground .Often my friends kicked a bunch to me from the boat . I always picked up bananas quickly and them under my apron.


Then I spent rest of the day eating bananas .I liked bananas ,But i like oranges bestof all.



           I only took thining when i fount them. but some people pianned a theft very carefully. clem jones was a carrying a box. what have you  got in policean.
          a cat replied clem please don t make me open the box. the cat will run away.

    'A Cat?' Pongo said .i don't believe you. Open the Box.'
